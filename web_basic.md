## HTML: The Structure

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the **structure and meaning (semantics)** of your web content. It is the skeleton of every webpage.

### Core Philosophy
*   **Separation of Concerns:** HTML is for content and structure ONLY. Style belongs in CSS, and interactivity belongs in JavaScript.
*   **Semantics is Key:** Use the HTML tag that best describes the content it holds. This is crucial for **Accessibility (screen readers), SEO (search engines), and Maintainability (for other developers)**.

### Boilerplate & Essential Tags

Every HTML document starts with this boilerplate.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document Title</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- All visible content goes here -->
    <script src="script.js" defer></script>
</body>
</html>
```

*   `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type. Always first.
*   `<html>`: The root element of the page. `lang="en"` is for accessibility.
*   `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the page (not visible).
    *   `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: Sets character encoding to handle most characters and symbols.
    *   `<meta name="viewport"...>`: **Essential for responsive design.** Makes the site's width equal to the device's screen width and sets the initial zoom level.
    *   `<title>`: The title shown in the browser tab.
    *   `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`: Links your external CSS file.
*   `<body>`: Contains all the visible content of the page.
*   `<script src="script.js" defer>`: Links your external JavaScript file. **`defer` is critical**; it makes the script execute only after the HTML has been fully parsed, preventing errors from trying to access elements that don't exist yet.

### Semantic HTML

Instead of using `<div>` for everything, use these tags to give your content meaning.

| Tag | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `<header>` | Introductory content for a page or section. Often contains navigation and a logo. |
| `<nav>` | Contains navigation links. |
| `<main>` | The main, unique content of the page. There should only be **one** `<main>` per page. |
| `<article>` | A self-contained piece of content (e.g., blog post, news story, forum post). |
| `<section>` | A thematic grouping of content. Should almost always have a heading. |
| `<aside>` | "Side-bar" content that is tangentially related to the main content (e.g., related links, ads). |
| `<footer>` | The footer of a page or section. Often contains copyright, contact info, etc. |
| `<figure>` & `<figcaption>` | Used to wrap an image, diagram, or code snippet and provide a caption for it. |
| `<h1>`-`<h6>` | Heading levels. `<h1>` is the most important; use them in logical order without skipping levels. |
| `<p>` | A paragraph of text. |
| `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>` | Unordered list (bullets), Ordered list (numbers), and the List Item itself. |

### Forms

Forms are used to collect user input.

```html
<form action="/submit-path" method="POST">
    <label for="username">Username:</label>
    <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required minlength="4">

    <label for="password">Password:</label>
    <input type="password" id="password" name="user_password">

    <input type="checkbox" id="remember" name="remember_me">
    <label for="remember">Remember Me</label>

    <button type="submit">Log In</button>
</form>
```

*   `<form>`: The container for form elements.
    *   `action`: The URL where the form data is sent.
    *   `method`: The HTTP method to use (`GET` for non-sensitive data, `POST` for sensitive data).
*   `<input>`: The most versatile form element. The `type` attribute is key.
    *   Common types: `text`, `password`, `email`, `number`, `checkbox`, `radio`, `submit`.
*   `<label>`: **Crucial for accessibility.** The `for` attribute must match the `id` of the input it describes. Clicking the label focuses the input.
*   `<textarea>`: For multi-line text input.
*   `<select>` and `<option>`: For dropdown menus.
*   `<button type="submit">`: A more flexible way to create a submit button than `<input type="submit">`.

### Attributes & Accessibility

*   `id`: A **unique** identifier for an element.
*   `class`: A non-unique identifier to group multiple elements.
*   `href`: Specifies the URL for a link (`<a>`).
*   `src`: Specifies the source URL for media like `<img>` and `<script>`.
*   `alt`: **Required** for `<img>` tags. Provides alternative text for screen readers or if the image fails to load. Describe the image's content and function.
*   `disabled`: Disables an input or button.
*   `required`: Makes a form input mandatory.

---

## CSS: The Presentation

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to **style and lay out** the HTML content. It controls colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.

### Core Philosophy & Syntax

*   **Keep it External:** Always use an external stylesheet (`.css` file) linked in the `<head>`. This maintains the separation of concerns.
*   **The "Cascade":** CSS rules "cascade" down. The final style of an element is determined by a combination of Inheritance, Specificity, and Source Order.

**Basic Syntax:**
```css
selector {
  property: value;
  another-property: another-value;
}
```

### Selectors, Specificity & The Cascade

How CSS decides which rule to apply.

*   **Selectors:**
    *   **Type:** `p` (selects all `<p>` elements)
    *   **Class:** `.card` (selects all elements with `class="card"`)
    *   **ID:** `#main-header` (selects the one element with `id="main-header"`)
    *   **Descendant:** `article p` (selects any `p` inside an `article`)
    *   **Child:** `ul > li` (selects any `li` that is a direct child of a `ul`)
    *   **Pseudo-class:** `a:hover` (selects a link when the mouse is over it), `:nth-child(2n)` (selects every even child)
    *   **Pseudo-element:** `p::first-line` (styles the first line of a paragraph)

*   **Specificity (The Priority System):**
    1.  **Inline Styles:** `style="..."` (Highest priority - avoid using!)
    2.  **IDs:** `#id`
    3.  **Classes, Pseudo-classes, Attribute selectors:** `.class`, `:hover`, `[type="text"]`
    4.  **Type selectors, Pseudo-elements:** `p`, `::before`
    *   A more specific selector (e.g., `#id`) will always override a less specific one (e.g., `.class`).
    *   `!important`: Overrides all other rules. Use this as a last resort for debugging; it's a sign of specificity problems.

*   **Inheritance:** Some properties (like `color`, `font-family`, `font-size`) are passed down from parent elements to their children. Others (like `border`, `padding`, `margin`) are not.

### The Box Model

Every element on a page is a rectangular box.



*   **Content:** The text, image, or other content inside the element.
*   **Padding:** The space between the content and the border.
*   **Border:** A line that goes around the padding and content.
*   **Margin:** The transparent space *outside* the border, separating it from other elements.

**CRITICAL RULE:** Always set this at the top of your CSS file.

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
This changes the box model so that the `width` and `height` properties include the `padding` and `border`, not just the content. It makes layout math infinitely more predictable.

### Layout: Flexbox & Grid

These are the two modern pillars of CSS layout.

#### Flexbox (1-Dimensional Layout)

Perfect for laying out items in a single row or column.

**Container (Parent) Properties:**
```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex; /* This is the magic! */
  flex-direction: row; /* or column, row-reverse, column-reverse */
  justify-content: center; /* Aligns items along the main axis (horizontally if row) */
  align-items: center; /* Aligns items along the cross axis (vertically if row) */
  gap: 1rem; /* Creates space between flex items */
  flex-wrap: wrap; /* Allows items to wrap to the next line if they run out of space */
}
```
*   `justify-content`: `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`.
*   `align-items`: `stretch`, `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`.

**Item (Child) Properties:**
```css
.flex-item {
  flex-grow: 1; /* Allows item to grow to fill available space */
  flex-shrink: 0; /* Prevents item from shrinking */
  flex-basis: 200px; /* Sets the initial size of the item */
  /* flex: 1 0 200px; is shorthand for the above */
}
```

#### Grid (2-Dimensional Layout)

Perfect for complex page layouts with rows AND columns.

**Container (Parent) Properties:**
```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid; /* The magic! */
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; /* Creates 3 equal-fraction columns */
  /* Or: grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); */
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr; /* First row height is automatic, second takes up remaining space */
  gap: 20px; /* Space between rows and columns */
}
```
*   `fr` unit: A fractional unit that represents a fraction of the available space in the grid container. It's the best unit for grid columns.

**Item (Child) Properties:**
```css
.grid-item-1 {
  grid-column: 1 / 3; /* Makes this item span from grid line 1 to 3 (taking up 2 columns) */
  grid-row: 1 / 2;    /* Makes this item sit in the first row */
}
```

### Responsive Design & Units

Making your site look good on all screen sizes.

*   **Mobile-First Approach:** Design for small screens first, then use media queries to add styles for larger screens.
*   **Media Queries:** Apply CSS rules only when certain conditions are met (like screen width).

```css
/* Base styles (mobile) */
.container {
  width: 90%;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

/* Tablet and larger */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    width: 80%;
  }
}

/* Desktop and larger */
@media (min-width: 1200px) {
  .container {
    max-width: 1140px;
  }
}
```
*   **Units:**
    *   `px`: Pixels. Absolute, use for things you want to have a fixed size (like `border-width`).
    *   `%`, `vw`, `vh`: Relative to the parent element's width or the viewport's width/height. Good for fluid layouts.
    *   `rem`: Relative to the root (`<html>`) element's font size. **The best unit for `font-size` and `margin`/`padding`** because it scales predictably and respects the user's browser font settings for accessibility.
    *   `em`: Relative to the current element's font size. Can be tricky due to compounding.

### Positioning

How elements are placed outside the normal document flow.

*   `position: static;` (Default)
*   `position: relative;`: The element is positioned relative to its normal position. Used as an anchor for `absolute` children.
*   `position: absolute;`: The element is removed from the normal flow and positioned relative to its **nearest positioned ancestor** (any ancestor with `position` other than `static`). If none exists, it's positioned relative to the `<body>`.
*   `position: fixed;`: The element is positioned relative to the viewport (the browser window). It stays in the same place even when the page is scrolled.
*   `position: sticky;`: A hybrid. It behaves like `relative` until it hits a specified threshold (e.g., `top: 0`), then it behaves like `fixed`.

## JavaScript: The Logic

JavaScript brings **interactivity and dynamic behavior** to your webpage. It's a programming language that runs in the browser.

### Core Philosophy & Syntax

*   **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Use functions and loops to avoid writing the same code over and over.
*   **Readability Counts:** Write clean, well-commented code that is easy for you and others to understand.

```javascript
// This is a single-line comment

/*
This is a
multi-line comment
*/

// Semicolons are technically optional but are good practice.
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

### Variables, Data Types & Operators

*   **Variables (How to store data):**
    *   `let`: A modern variable. Can be reassigned. Block-scoped (only exists within `{}`).
    *   `const`: A modern constant. Cannot be reassigned. Also block-scoped. **Use `const` by default** unless you know you need to reassign the variable.
    *   `var`: The old way. Avoid it. It has confusing function-scoping rules.

*   **Data Types (The types of data):**
    *   **Primitives:**
        *   `String`: "Hello world"
        *   `Number`: 42, 3.14
        *   `Boolean`: `true`, `false`
        *   `null`: Intentionally empty value.
        *   `undefined`: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
    *   **Objects:**
        *   `Object`: A collection of key-value pairs. `{ name: 'Alice', age: 30 }`
        *   `Array`: An ordered list of values. `[1, 'apple', true]`

*   **Operators:**
    *   **Assignment:** `=`
    *   **Arithmetic:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (modulus/remainder)
    *   **Comparison:** `===` (strict equality - checks type and value, **always use this**), `!==` (strict inequality), `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
    *   **Logical:** `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT)

### Control Flow & Functions

*   **Conditional Statements:**
    ```javascript
    const age = 18;
    if (age >= 18) {
      console.log("You can vote.");
    } else {
      console.log("You cannot vote yet.");
    }
    ```
*   **Loops:**
    ```javascript
    // For loop
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      console.log(i);
    }

    // For...of loop (for iterating over arrays)
    const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
    for (const fruit of fruits) {
      console.log(fruit);
    }
    ```
*   **Functions:** Reusable blocks of code.
    ```javascript
    // Function Declaration
    function greet(name) {
      return `Hello, ${name}!`;
    }

    // Arrow Function (modern, concise syntax)
    const add = (a, b) => {
      return a + b;
    };

    // Implicit return for single-line arrow functions
    const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;

    console.log(greet('Odin')); // "Hello, Odin!"
    console.log(add(5, 3));      // 8
    ```

### The DOM: Connecting JS to the Page

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.

*   **Selecting Elements:**
    *   `document.querySelector('selector')`: Returns the **first** element that matches a CSS selector. This is your go-to method.
    *   `document.querySelectorAll('selector')`: Returns a **NodeList** (like an array) of all elements that match a CSS selector.
    *   `document.getElementById('id')`: The old, fast way to get an element by its ID.

*   **Manipulating Elements:**
    ```javascript
    // Select the element
    const heading = document.querySelector('h1');

    // Change its text content
    heading.textContent = 'A New Heading';

    // Change its style
    heading.style.color = 'blue';
    heading.style.backgroundColor = 'lightgray';

    // Add/remove/toggle CSS classes (THE BEST WAY TO CHANGE STYLES)
    heading.classList.add('important-title');
    heading.classList.remove('old-class');
    heading.classList.toggle('active');

    // Create and add new elements
    const newParagraph = document.createElement('p');
    newParagraph.textContent = 'This was added by JavaScript!';
    document.body.appendChild(newParagraph);
    ```

### Events: Making Pages Interactive

Events are actions that happen in the browser, like a user clicking a button or pressing a key. We can "listen" for these events and run code in response.

*   **The `addEventListener` Method:** The modern, preferred way to handle events.

```javascript
const myButton = document.querySelector('#myButton');

function onButtonClick(event) {
  console.log('Button was clicked!');
  console.log(event.target); // The element that triggered the event (the button)
}

myButton.addEventListener('click', onButtonClick);
```

*   **Common Events:** `click`, `submit`, `keydown`, `keyup`, `mouseover`, `load`.
*   **The `event` Object:** The function you pass to `addEventListener` automatically receives an `event` object with useful information.
    *   `event.target`: The element that the event occurred on.
    *   `event.preventDefault()`: **Crucial for form submissions.** Prevents the browser's default behavior (like reloading the page) so you can handle the submission with JavaScript.

### Arrays & Objects

*   **Objects:** For grouping related data.
    ```javascript
    const user = {
      firstName: 'Jane',
      lastName: 'Doe',
      age: 28,
      fullName: function() {
        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
      }
    };
    console.log(user.firstName); // Dot notation
    console.log(user['lastName']); // Bracket notation
    console.log(user.fullName()); // "Jane Doe"
    ```
*   **Arrays:** For ordered lists of data. **Master these methods.**
    *   `forEach()`: Executes a function for each array element.
    *   `map()`: Creates a **new array** by performing a function on each array element.
    *   `filter()`: Creates a **new array** with all elements that pass a test.
    *   `reduce()`: Reduces an array to a single value (e.g., summing all numbers).
    ```javascript
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
    const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]
    const evens = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0); // [2, 4, 6]
    const sum = numbers.reduce((total, current) => total + current, 0); // 21
    ```

### Asynchronous JavaScript: Promises & Async/Await

JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can only do one thing at a time. Asynchronous operations (like fetching data from a server) allow the browser to remain responsive while waiting for the operation to complete.

*   **Promises:** An object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation.
    *   States: `pending`, `fulfilled`, `rejected`.
    *   `.then()`: Runs when the promise is fulfilled (successful).
    *   `.catch()`: Runs when the promise is rejected (error).
    *   `.finally()`: Runs regardless of success or failure.

*   **The `fetch` API (A real-world example of Promises):**
    ```javascript
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => {
        if (!response.ok) {
          throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
        }
        return response.json(); // .json() also returns a promise!
      })
      .then(data => {
        console.log('Success:', data);
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error:', error);
      });
    ```
*   **Async/Await (Modern Syntactic Sugar):** A cleaner way to work with promises, making async code look more like synchronous code.
    *   `async`: Put this
