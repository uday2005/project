        <p class="Introduction-block">
          I'm Uday Kumar, a BS Chemistry student at IITB, originally from Bihar.
          <br />
          My first year on campus has been a journey of profound learning.
          <br />
          While it came with its own unique set of challenges and didn't unfold
          exactly as I had envisioned, <br />
          it has been a crucial period of growth, setting a strong foundation
          for the future.

        <h2>Learnings and Growth</h2>
        <p>
          During my first year, I applied to two tech teams but was rejected
          after the interviews. <br />This experience taught me the importance
          of strong communication skills.<br />
          Over the year, I primarily developed my skills in machine learning and
          also spent time on competitive programming.<br />
          I completed a course on financial markets offered by Yale University
          through Coursera.<br />
          Additionally, I worked on a project for ENT101, where I studied Myntra
          as a company from its inception.
